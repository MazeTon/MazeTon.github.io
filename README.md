2. **Navigate the Maze**:
   - On **mobile devices**, swipe in the direction you wish to move.
   - On **desktop**, use the arrow keys or WASD keys.
   - Alternatively, use your mouse's scroll wheel to move.
3. **Find the Exit**: Reach the glowing portal to complete the maze.
4. **Collect Items**: Pick up items along the way for extra points.
5. **Advance**: Each completed maze increases in size and difficulty.

## üïπ Features

- **Intuitive Controls**: Seamless movement controls optimized for both mobile and desktop.
- **Stunning 3D Graphics**: Experience high-quality visuals rendered with Three.js.
- **Progress Saving**: Your position and progress are saved automatically.
- **Social Integration**: Connect with friends, view leaderboards, and share your achievements.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Mazes grow in complexity as you advance, keeping the challenge fresh.

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React** with **TypeScript**: For robust and maintainable UI development.
- **Three.js** and **@react-three/fiber**: Rendering the 3D maze environment.
- **@react-three/drei**: Enhancing Three.js with useful helpers and abstractions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development server and build tool.

### Backend

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for handling game logic and user data.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user profiles and maze configurations.
- **AWS SDK v3**: Interacting with AWS services in a scalable manner.

### Integration

- **Telegram WebApp API**: Embedding the game within Telegram for easy access.
- **Telegram Cloud Storage**: Saving user progress and settings across devices.

## üí° Game Logic

### Maze Generation

- **Procedural Generation**: Each maze is generated using a depth-first search algorithm with backtracking, ensuring a unique and solvable maze every time.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The maze size increases incrementally, adding one unit to either the width or height after each completion, up to a maximum size.
- **Randomized Elements**: Walls, floors, player avatars, and portals are assigned random colors for a vibrant experience.

### Player Progression

- **Starting Point**: All players begin at the bottom-left corner of the maze.
- **Objective**: Reach the portal located at the farthest point from the starting position.
- **Scoring System**:
  - **Maze Completion**: Earn points equal to the area of the maze (width √ó height).
  - **Item Collection**: Additional points are awarded for each item collected.
- **Item Placement**:
  - Items appear in mazes larger than 10√ó10.
  - Positioned away from the start and finish to encourage exploration.

### Fair Play Enforcement

- **Anti-Cheat Measures**:
  - Minimum completion time is enforced based on the shortest possible path.
  - Players completing mazes suspiciously fast are temporarily blocked.
- **Penalty System**:
  - First offense results in a 1-hour block.
  - Subsequent offenses double the block duration, up to 24 hours.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm**: To run and build the project locally.
