## Features

### üî• AI-Generated Unique Mazes

Every maze in MazeTon is **dynamically generated by AI** based on each user‚Äôs gameplay progress and skill level. No two mazes are alike, ensuring a unique experience every time you play.

### üéÆ Progressive Difficulty

As you advance through the game, the AI increases the maze's size and complexity, introducing new challenges and exciting gameplay dynamics.

### üåê Built-in Telegram Integration

MazeTon is designed specifically for Telegram, allowing you to play seamlessly without leaving the app. Invite friends, share achievements, and compete directly from your Telegram chat.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Social and Viral Mechanics

- **Leaderboards**: See how you rank against friends and the broader MazeTon community.
- **Friend Challenges**: Challenge your friends to complete mazes faster or achieve higher scores.
- **Achievements**: Collect badges and share them with your network as you reach new milestones in the game.

### üèÜ Gamification and Rewards

- **Score System**: Earn points for completing mazes, which add up to increase your rank.
- **Item Collection**: Discover items hidden in mazes that can enhance gameplay or unlock special features.
- **Referral Rewards**: Earn in-game bonuses by inviting friends to join MazeTon.

## üîí Anti-Bot Protection

To protect against bots, MazeTon implements various delays in the game. For example, when picking up an item, a 5-second animation will play. Additionally, each move takes 0.2 seconds.

Knowing the minimum number of moves required to complete a maze, we calculate the fastest legitimate completion time. If a player completes the maze faster than this, they are flagged and penalized as follows:

- **1st Violation**: 1-hour block.
- **2nd Violation**: 2-hour block.
- **3rd Violation**: 4-hour block.
- Penalty durations double with each subsequent violation, up to a maximum of 24 hours.

Additionally, **impassable mazes** will be introduced, requiring special superpowers (e.g., Wall Jump, Teleport) to complete. These will also factor into the minimum completion time to prevent abuse.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### üõçÔ∏è In-Game Store

A store will be added, allowing players to buy and sell items and superpowers. Example superpowers include:

- **Wall Jump**: Skip over a wall.
- **Teleport**: Move a few spaces forward instantly.
- **Speed Boost**: Reduce movement time for a limited duration.
- etc.

### üí∞ TON Wallet Integration

Players will be able to withdraw earned score points to their TON wallets. This will be facilitated through a distribution mechanism on the TON blockchain.

## üåê Tokenomics

The MazeTon project will issue its own tokens, with allocation as follows:

```markdown
- Game Fund: 50%
- Marketing: 30%
- Community: 10%
- Team: 5%
- Presale: 5%
```

### Token Issuance Model

The total number of tokens issued will be determined by the number of players. Since the maximum points a player can generate in 24 uninterrupted games is known, the token limit will be calculated based on player counts to ensure a sustainable economy.

```mermaid
pie title Total Tokens
    "Game Fund" : 50
    "Marketing" : 30
    "Community" : 10
    "Team" : 5
    "Presale" : 5
```

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React** with **TypeScript**: For robust and maintainable UI development.
- **Three.js** and **@react-three/fiber**: Rendering the 3D maze environment.
- **@react-three/drei**: Enhancing Three.js with useful helpers and abstractions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development server and build tool.

### Backend

## üí° Game Logic

### Maze Generation

- **Procedural Generation**: Each maze is generated using a depth-first search algorithm with backtracking, ensuring a unique and solvable maze every time.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The maze size increases incrementally, adding one unit to either the width or height after each completion, up to a maximum size.
- **Randomized Elements**: Walls, floors, player avatars, and portals are assigned random colors for a vibrant experience.

### Player Progression

- **Starting Point**: All players begin at the bottom-left corner of the maze.
- **Objective**: Reach the portal located at the farthest point from the starting position.
- **Scoring System**:
  - **Maze Completion**: Earn points equal to the area of the maze (width √ó height).
  - **Item Collection**: Additional points are awarded for each item collected.
- **Item Placement**:
  - Items appear in mazes larger than 10√ó10.
  - Positioned away from the start and finish to encourage exploration.
